		<h2>Newton Sans Font</h2>
		<p>The Chymistry of Isaac Newton Project uses its own font, called 
			'Newton Sans', to present Newton's edited manuscripts 
			online&#x2014;complete with his alchemical symbols&#x2014;without 
			readers needing to install the font on their own equipment.</p> 
		<p>If interested, you are welcome to download the 2025 version of the 
			open source 'Newton Sans' font for use in research and writing. </p>
		<p>⯈ <a download="download" href="/font/NewtonSans-UnicodeFont-2025-09-09.zip"> 
			Download Newton Sans Font v. 09.2025.</a> (Licenses and source 
			fonts are included in the ZIP file.)</p>
		<p>Save the ZIP file to your machine, uncompress it, then copy the 
			TrueType font (.TTF) file to your machine's Fonts folder. If 
			successful, the font will appear in your font selection lists as 
			<em>Newton Sans</em> or <em>Newton Sans Regular</em> and can be 
			used in most programs. (The WOFF and WOFF2 versions are web fonts 
			optimized for screens and not intended for print.)</p>
		<p>The 'Newton Sans' font was first offered on our site in 2010, but as 
			work progressed new symbols were needed so we released updated 
			versions in 2015 and again in 2025.</p>
		<h4>Collaboration with Unicode Consortium and creation of the Alchemy plane</h4>
		<p>In 2008, members of the Chymistry Project began to meet with the 
			Technical Committee of the Unicode Consortium with goal of adding a 
			new plane to the Unicode Standard for a large set of alchemical 
			symbols in common use in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Our 
			<a href="/font/Alchemy%20Unicode%20Proposal---March%2031%202009.pdf">
			Alchemy Unicode Proposal</a> was officially adopted in 2009-10 and 
			the alchemy plane was incorporated in Unicode 6.0 and later. The 
			<a href="/font/Unicode-U1F700.pdf">Unicode Alchemy plane,</a> 
			defined in cells 1F700-1F7FF, includes alchemical symbols that were 
			in regular use in printed publications in the sixteenth and 
			seventeenth centuries.</p>
		<p>The 'Newton Sans' font covers all the symbols defined in the alchemy 
			plane of the Unicode Standard, and for each alchemical symbol we used 
			glyphs appropriate to Newton studies. But different alchemists used 
			different symbols for the same substances, so we acknowledge that 
			other scholarly projects may need to replace Newton's glyphs with 
			glyphs more appropriate to the usages of other alchemical authors.</p>
		<h4>Other symbols in 'Newton Sans'</h4>
		<p>The symbols or special characters of particular interest in the 
			'Newton Sans' font can be seen on this 
			<a href="symbols">Symbols</a> page.</p>
		<p>Unicode had already defined many symbols used by alchemists on other 
			planes in the Standard. For example, some alchemical symbols 
			already had more than one meaning when Newton and his colleagues 
			were using them, like the astrological symbols which stood for both 
			planets and elements. And he used standard symbols to mark units of 
			weight still used today by pharmacists and jewellers. Unicode had 
			assigned most of these familiar symbols to the Miscellaneous 
			Symbols plane, 2600-26FF.</p>
		<p>To correct his notes, Newton used recognizable editorial marks, and 
			to write Latin, he used a small number of conventional Latin 
			abbreviations to simplify regular suffixes and omissions, which 
			have all been added to the font.</p> 
		<p>Finally, to publish Newton's alchemical writings fully and accurately, 
			we needed to create many additional nonstandard alchemical symbols. 
			Newton frequently modified familiar alchemical symbols to extend their 
			meanings in context, but the modifications were unique to his own 
			work and, so, were not added to the Alchemy plane.</p>
		<p>Symbols not defined in the Alchemy plane or elsewhere in Unicode, 
			were placed in the private use area (PUA), E000-EFFF.</p>
		<h4>Unicode planes represented in 'Newton Sans'</h4>
		<p>The 'Newton Sans' font inherited broad linguistic coverage from its 
			source fonts (included in the ZIP file), so it includes non-Latin 
			scripts like Greek, Hebrew, and Cyrillic, all of which Newton 
			occasionally used in his notes, and Arabic, which he did not use 
			but which is central to the history of alchemy. </p>
		<p>The 'Newton Sans' font provides coverage in these Unicode blocks: 
			Basic Latin; Latin-1 Supplement; Latin Extended-A; Latin Extended-B; 
			IPA Extensons; Spacing Modifier Characters; Greek and Coptic; 
			Cyrillic; Hebrew; Arabic; Latin Extended Additional; Greek Extended; 
			General Punctuation; Superscripts and Subscripts; Currency Symbols; 
			Letterlike Symbols; Number Forms; Arrows; Mathematical Operators; 
			Miscellaneous Technical; Enclosed Alphanumerics; Box Drawing; Block 
			Elements; Geometric Shapes; Miscellaneous Symbols; Dingbats; Private 
			Use Area (PUA); Alphabetic Presentation Forms; and Alchemical Symbols.</p>
