		<h2>Newton Sans Font</h2>
		<p>The Chymistry of Isaac Newton Project uses its own font, called 'Newton Sans', to present Newton's edited manuscripts 
		online&#x2014;complete with his alchemical symbols&#x2014;without readers needing to install the font on their own equipment.</p> 
		<p>If interested, you are welcome to download the 2025 version of the open source 'Newton Sans' font for use in research and writing. </p>
		<p>⯈ <a download="download" href="/font/NewtonSans-UnicodeFont-2025-09-09.zip">Download Newton Sans Font v. 09.2025.</a> 
		(Licenses and source fonts are included in the ZIP file.)</p>
		<p>Save the ZIP file to your machine, uncompress it, then copy the TrueType font (.TTF) file to your machine's Fonts folder. 
		If successful, the font will appear in your font selection lists as <em>Newton Sans Regular</em> and can be used in most programs. 
		(The WOFF and WOFF2 fonts are for screens and not for print.)</p>
		<p>The 'Newton Sans' font was first offered on our site in 2010, but as work progressed new symbols were needed  
		so we released updated versions in 2015 and again in 2025.</p>
		<h4>Collaboration with Unicode Consortium and creation of the Alchemy plane</h4>
		<p>In 2008, members of the Chymistry Project began to meet with the Technical Committee of the Unicode Consortium 
		with goal of adding a new plane to the Unicode Standard for a large set of alchemical symbols in common use in 
		the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Our 
		<a href="/font/Alchemy%20Unicode%20Proposal---March%2031%202009.pdf">Alchemy Unicode Proposal</a> 
		was officially adopted in 2009-10 and the alchemy plane was incorporated in Unicode 6.0 and later. The 
		<a href="/font/Unicode-U1F700.pdf">Unicode Alchemy plane,</a> in cells 1F700-1F7FF, includes 
		alchemical symbols that were in regular use in printed publications in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.</p>
		<p>The 'Newton Sans' font covers all the symbols defined in the alchemy plane of the Unicode Standard but for each alchemical 
		symbol we used glyphs appropriate to Newton studies. Given the acknowledged existence of variant symbols for the same substances, we 
		want to point out that fonts for other scholarly projects may need to replace Newton's glyphs with other glyphs more appropriate to 
		the usages of other alchemical authors.</p>
		<h4>Other symbols in 'Newton Sans'</h4>
		<p>To publish Newton's alchemical writings fully and accurately, we needed to create many additional nonstandard alchemical symbols.
		Newton frequently modified base alchemical symbols in his manuscripts to extend their meanings in context but he did so in ways 
		not seen elsewhere in the alchemical literature. Additionally, Newton corrected his notes by using a large set of editorial marks, 
		some still in use today, and he used a small number of conventional Latin abbreviations when writing Latin. All of these are included 
		in the 'Newton Sans' font and have been documented on our <a href="symbols">Symbols page</a>. </p>
		<p>A significant number of symbols used by alchemists were already defined on other planes in the Unicode Standard. Some alchemical 
		symbols already had more than one meaning when Newton and his colleagues were using them, like astrological symbols which stood both 
		for planets and for elements. Some symbols that Newton used to mark units of weight actually remain in use today by pharmacists
		and jewellers. Most of those more common symbols had already been assigned to Unicode's Miscellaneous Symbols plane, 2600-26FF.</p>
		<p>Symbols that are found in Newton's manuscripts but are not defined in the Alchemy plane or elsewhere in Unicode all reside 
		in the private use area (PUA), E000-EFFF.</p>
		<h4>Unicode planes represented in 'Newton Sans'</h4>
		<p>The 'Newton Sans' font inherited broad linguistic coverage from its source fonts, which are included in the ZIP file. The font 
		includes non-Latin scripts like Greek, Hebrew, and Cyrillic, all of which Newton occasionally used in his notes, and for Arabic, 
		which he did not use but which is central to the history of alchemy. </p>
		<p>The 'Newton Sans' font provides coverage for the following Unicode blocks: Basic Latin; Latin-1 Supplement; Latin Extended-A; 
		Latin Extended-B; IPA Extensons; Spacing Modifier Characters; Greek and Coptic; Cyrillic; Hebrew; Arabic; Latin Extended Additional; 
		Greek Extended; General Punctuation; Superscripts and Subscripts; Currency Symbols; Letterlike Symbols; Number Forms; Arrows; 
		Mathematical Operators; Miscellaneous Technical; Enclosed Alphanumerics; Box Drawing; Block Elements; Geometric Shapes; 
		Miscellaneous Symbols; Dingbats; Private Use Area (PUA); Alphabetic Presentation Forms; and Alchemical Symbols.</p>
