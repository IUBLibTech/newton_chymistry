				<h2>Experiments in Mineral Acids</h2>
				<p> Mineral acids were some of the most frequently used substances in
					Newton&#39;s chymistry. These included &quot;oyl of vitriol&quot;
					(sulfuric acid), &quot;aqua fortis&quot; (nitric acid), and
					&quot;spirit of salt&quot; (hydrochloric acid), in addition to various
					combinations of these such as &quot;aqua regia&quot; (nitric acid &amp;
					hydrochloric acid). Drawing from the works on &quot;strong waters&quot;
					of Islamic alchemists such as Jabir ibn Hayyan (c. ninth-tenth century) and
					Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Zakariya' al-Razi
					(c. 865-925), medieval alchemists and physicians were the first to produce
					concentrated acids from the distillation of minerals (Robert Multhauf,
					The Relationship Between Technology and Natural Philosophy, ca. 1250-1650,
					as Illustrated by <em>Technology of the Mineral Acids</em> (Ph.D. Dissertation,
					University of California, 1953), pp. 140-141). Newton describes these
					acids and the method for making them in the manuscript Oxford University,
					Bodleian Library Don b. 15. </p>
				<h3> The &quot;Oyl of Vitriol&quot; </h3>
				<p> Don b. 15 pp.4r &amp; 7r: </p>
				<blockquote class="genericBlockquote"> &quot;Oyle of Vitrioll is acid destild from vitrioll first calcined to
					whitenesse for feare of boyling over when it
					&lt;illeg.&gt;
					. The fumes are white but sattle into this reddish liquor.&quot; </blockquote>
				<p></p>
				<p> Newton has another description of the process in the same manuscript on
					p.8v: </p>
				<blockquote class="genericBlockquote"> &quot;Spt of Vitrioll &amp; Oyle. Deflegm ye vitrioll &amp;c a &lt;illeg&gt; yt circulatory fire

				<p></p>
				<p> The English chymist and physician John French (1616-1657) described a
					similar method for the production of oil of vitriol, and he also
					included a picture of the apparatus used for distilling various mineral
					acids. </p>

				</div>
				<p> French describes the process as follows: </p>

					glasse Retort well luted, or an earthen Retort that will endure the
					fire: Fit a large Receiver to the Retort and close the joints wel
					together; then give it fire by degrees till the second day, then make

				<p></p>
				<p> In our reproduction of Newton&#39;s method for making the oil of vitriol,
					we constructed a temporary furnace using a steel tabletop barbecue
					surrounded by insulating firebrick. For a fuel source we used 100%
					natural hardwood charcoal. We used a specially made Pyrex retort and
					passed the condensing arm through a bucket of ice into a receiving
					flask. As per Newton&#39;s instructions, we did not seal the receiving
					flask to the retort. </p>
				<p> We &quot;dephlegmed&quot; our vitriol (FeSO<sub>4</sub>·7H<sub>2</sub>O) in a glass
					crystallizing dish on a hotplate until the material ceased evolving
					steam, had lost its green and blue color, and appeared a greyish
					yellow. After allowing the material to cool, we placed it in the glass
					retort and began heating in the fire. </p>

				<p> Shortly after the temperature reached 400° C as measured by a
					thermocouple probe rated to 1000° C the color of the ferrous sulphate
					began to change to red. This is the temperature at which ferrous
					sulphate decomposes. </p>

				<p> We immediately began to evolve a clear, acidic vapor, which we measured

				<p> After proceeding with the distillation for approximately 4 hours at
					increased temperatures (the highest was near 1000° C), the evolution of
					vapor slowed and we ceased to collect acid. The product obtained was a
					clear, highly acid liquid with a pungent (and painful) odor. </p>

				<p> Some water from our condenser seeped into the receiving flask and

					&quot;Alembic.&quot; After removing the excess water from the acid, the
					product was more viscous and had a measured pH of zero. </p>

				<h2> &quot;Aqua Fortis&quot; </h2>
				<p> Newton describes the production of aqua fortis in Don b. 15, p.1r: </p>

					the caput mortuum will afford a white salt &amp;c.&quot; </blockquote>
				<p></p>
				<p> John French has a similar description in his 1653 The Art of
					Distillation: </p>
				<blockquote class="genericBlockquote"> &quot;Take of vitriol calcined two parts and of nitre one part. Grind
					and mix them well together and put them into a glass retort coated or
					earthen retort that will endure the fire. Set them into the furnace in
					an open fire and then, having fitted a large receiver, distill it by
					degrees the space of 24 hours. Then rectify the water or spirit in
					sand.&quot; </blockquote>
				<p></p>
				<p> We began our distillation of aqua fortis with a similar apparatus as
					that used in our distillation of sulfuric acid. The furnace was
					practically identical (made from the tabletop barbecue and the
					firebrick, using natural charcoal as fuel), but instead of the glass
					retort and the ice condenser we used a 500mL roundbottom flask, a
					distilling adapter, a 400mm West condenser, and a large Erlenmeyer as a
					receiving flask. We cycled water through the condenser for the duration
					of the experiment. </p>

		border="1" style="width: 100%;" alt="Fig. 1" /> <br clear="all" />
					<small>Fig. 1: The furnace and our distillation apparatus.</small> </div>
				<p> As per Newton&#39;s description, we used two parts of calcined ferrous
					sulfate and one part potassium nitrate. We began heating the vessel and
					shortly after the temperature had reached approximately 500° C, we
					observed a red gas forming in the round bottom and the distillation
					adapter. </p>

					<small>Fig. 2: The formation of red gas.</small> </div>
				<p> This gas was very likely NO<sub>2</sub>. The gas filled the whole apparatus and
					some of the material began to assume liquid form (presumably as the gas
					combined with water in the air). </p>

					<small>Fig. 4: Red gas filling the entire apparatus.</small> </div>
				<p> We continued the distillation for approximately four hours, until it
					appeared that gas was no longer evolving. We collected the liquid acid
					in several vials but allowed the gas remaining in the receiving flask
					to sit overnight. Both the liquid and the vapor had a pH of zero (as
					measured with 0-14 pH paper). </p>

				<h2> &quot;Spirit of Salt&quot; </h2>
				<p> Newton describes the production of the spirit of salt (hydrochloric
					acid) in Don b. 15, p.8v, as follows: &quot;Spirit of Salt. Common
					salt, beat fine in 1 part brick-dust or potters earth not over dryed &amp;
					pouder 5 parts : urge by a graduall fire out of a glass retort filld
					full into a large receiver till you feel the receiver cold &amp; one pound
					will yeild nine or 10 ounces.&quot; </p>
				<p> John French describes this process in much the same way: &quot;Take one
					part of salt and three parts of powder of bricks or tiles, mix them
					together, and put them into a retort either of glass or earth, to which
					put fire as before. After this manner you may make oil or spirit of
					nitre, salt gem, alum. Note that these salts must first be calcined
					which is done by exhaling their phlegm.&quot; </p>
				<p> Newton&#39;s description of the ratio of fuller&#39;s earth to salt was
					difficult to understand, so we chose instead to use French&#39;s ratio of
					three parts fuller&#39;s earth (cosmetic clay) to one part sea salt
					(purchased at a local health-food store). We used the same apparatus as
					the above aqua fortis distillation, but tried for a higher temperature
					as sodium chloride decomposes at 801° C. </p>

		border="1" style="width: 100%;" alt="Fig. 1" /> <br clear="all" />
					<small>Fig. 1: Spirit of salt furnace and distillation
					apparatus.</small> </div>
				<p> By stacking our firebricks higher and using a larger amount of coal we
					were able to achieve higher temperatures, reaching and perhaps
					surpassing 1000°C according to our thermocouple (only rated to 1000°C).
					The distillation yielded a white, pungent gas and a clear, acidic
					liquid. We continued the distillation until liquid and gas ceased to
					evolve, but attempted to distill more product by making the fire very
					hot. </p>

				<p> During the distillation the glass appeared to be warping from the heat.
					After the distillation was finished and the glass had cooled, we
					observed that the Pyrex round bottom flask had been significantly
					melted by the fire. </p>
