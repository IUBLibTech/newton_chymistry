			<h1>Grant Proposal</h1>
			<p>The "Chymistry" of Isaac Newton: 
						Project Description <br />
						The State of Scholarship on Newton's Alchemy: Problems and Solutions</p>
		</header>
						
				<p> Thanks to the researches of B.J.T. Dobbs, Richard Westfall, and Karin 
					Figala, it is now well-known that Isaac Newton wrote at least one hundred 
					thirty one manuscripts, totaling approximately one million words, on the 
					subject of alchemy.<sup>1</sup> Despite the fact that much of this 
					material has been 
					available to scholars since its sale by Sotheby and Company in 1936, the 
					goals and protocols of Newton's alchemical endeavor as a whole remain poorly 
					understood, and the mass of manuscripts lies unedited, unannotated, and 
					largely undated.<sup>2</sup> This is surprising, given the intense 
					scholarly activity 
					that has focused over the years on Newton's mathematical, natural 
					philosophical, and optical papers.  And yet, despite their relative 
					obscurity, Newton's alchemical manuscripts have formed the basis of strong 
					revisionist statements about the nature of his scientific endeavor as a 
					whole.  Already in 1946, John Maynard Keynes used the alchemical papers to 
					make his famous claim that "Newton was not the first of the age of reason.  
					He was the last of the magicians."<sup>3</sup> Dobbs, on the other hand, 
					espoused the 
					view in her 1975 <i>Foundations of Newton's Alchemy</i> that Newton's theory 
					of gravitational attraction was inspired by his alchemical research.  
					Forced by her subsequent research to moderate this claim, Dobbs arrived in 
					her 1991 <i>Janus Faces of Genius</i> at the position that Newton's alchemy 
					was above all an expression of his religiosity.<sup>4</sup> Westfall too 
					shared this 
					view, and was inclined - along with the early Dobbs - to see alchemy as the 
					source for Newton's concept of attractive forces and active principles 
					operating within matter.<sup>5</sup> </p>
				<p> The interpretations of Newton's alchemy proffered by Dobbs and Westfall, 
					although considered radical when they first appeared in the mid-1970's, have 
					received no serious challenge.  To the contrary, they have become grist for 
					such popular-science writers as Michael White, whose 1997 <i>Isaac Newton: 
					The 
					Last Sorcerer</i> builds a sensationalist picture of Newton the alchemist on 
					material taken mostly from Dobbs' early work.  Why is it that so little 
					serious scholarly effort has been directed toward the understanding of 
					Newton's alchemy given the manifest interest that this topic holds for the 
					educated public and historians alike?  A major reason lies in the myriad 
					difficulties that anyone who wishes to deal with Newton's alchemical <i>Nachlass</i> must face.  The manuscripts, mostly located in Cambridge, 
					Jerusalem, and Massachusetts, are in a state of considerable disorder.  The 
					most telling index of this disarray, perhaps, may be found in the repeated 
					failure of previous Newton scholars to determine which of the manuscripts 
					were actually composed by Newton as opposed to being transcripts of authors 
					that he copied for his own use.<sup>6</sup> Dobbs and Westfall, 
					moreover, supply no 
					text-by-text analysis of Newton's alchemical sources, which would have been 
					a reasonable first step in determining which texts he actually wrote as 
					opposed to merely copying or abridging into compendia.  Although both 
					authors provided important insights about Newton's favorite alchemists, such 
					as Eirenaeus Philalethes (George Starkey), Michael Maier, and Jan de Monte 
					Snyder, they did not attempt to identify all the sources in any given text, 
					and expended even less effort in tracing Newton's use of sources over his 
					successive manuscripts.  Neither Dobbs nor Westfall made a systematic 
					attempt to date the various components of the alchemical collection in its 
					entirety, with the result that we have little sense, at present, of the 
					chronological development of Newton's ideas in the realm of 
					alchemy/chemistry.  Instead, the method of Dobbs and Westfall was to work 
					with "core-samples" taken from what they supposed to be different periods of 
					Newton's endeavor.  This technique was understandable, given the daunting 
					character of the material, and yet even a sympathetic critic must agree that 
					it could only lead to conclusions that were impressionistic at best. </p>
				<p>It is therefore clear that a new study of Newton's alchemy, 
					accompanied by a complete and scholarly online edition of his alchemical 
					manuscripts, is a desideratum.  Fortunately, since the publication of Dobbs' <i>Janus Faces</i> in 1991, three factors have made the understanding and 
					editing 
					of Newton's alchemical papers a much more favorable prospect than before.  
					First, the alchemical milieu in which Newton worked is now much better known 
					than it was in the 1970's and 1980's.  We now have a comprehensive study of 
					the life and work of the New England migr George Starkey (<i>alias</i> Eirenaeus 
					Philalethes), who was identified by Dobbs and Westfall as Newton's favorite 
					alchemist.  Additionally, the alchemy of Newton's contemporary and 
					scientific correspondent, Robert Boyle, has received a detailed study, as is 
					also the case with Starkey's tutelage of Boyle in the discipline of 
					"chymistry."<sup>7</sup> Like Newton, Boyle was deeply involved in a 
					research program 
					initiated by Philalethes-Starkey, and the two British savants exchanged 
					"secrets" derived from the American alchemist.<sup>8</sup> The ongoing 
					research on 
					Starkey, Boyle, and their alchemical papers will make it much easier than 
					before to place Newton's alchemical interests in context, to identify his 
					sources, and, crucially, to determine which manuscripts are original 
					compositions by Newton as opposed to unadulterated transcripts, partial 
					transcripts with bracketed commentary, or even mosaic-like pastiches of 
					snippets cobbled together from a variety of authors.  As shown by Newman in 
					1987, the distinguishing of Newton's transcripts from his own compositions 
					is a problem of the first magnitude that is best solved by having an 
					intimate knowledge of the literature of alchemy as it existed in the 
					seventeenth century.  An acquaintance with the unpublished manuscripts of 
					Starkey allowed Newman to show then that Dobbs had incorrectly claimed that 
					Newton authored a foundational work entitled Clavis, which was actually part 
					of a letter written by Starkey to Boyle in 1651.<sup>9</sup> In the 
					electronic 
					edition 
					that we propose, we will include all of Newton's chymical writings in 
					word-searchable form with annotations indicating their sources and the 
					degree of Newtonian input into them. </p>
				<p>Second, our picture of early modern alchemy as a whole has undergone 
					considerable change since the work of Dobbs and Westfall.  As Lawrence 
					Principe and William Newman have argued in several co-authored publications, 
					it is anachronistic to distinguish "alchemy" from "chemistry" in the 
					seventeenth century.<sup>10</sup> The attempt to transmute metals, often 
					called <i>chrysopoeia</i> (Greek for "gold-making") in the early modern period, was 
					a normal pursuit carried out by most of those who were engaged in the varied 
					realm of iatrochemistry, scientific metallurgy, and chemical technology.  
					The fact that Newton, Boyle, Locke, and other celebrated natural 
					philosophers were engaged in chrysopoeia is no aberration by 
					seventeenth-century standards.  Hence Newman and Principe have adopted the 
					inclusive term "chymistry," an actor's category employed during the 
					seventeenth century, to describe this overarching discipline.  But how does 
					this affect our picture of Newton's alchemy, and how is it likely to 
					influence the direction of future research?  Dobbs and Westfall erected a 
					strong dichotomy between early modern "alchemy" and "chemistry."  Drawing on 
					a romantic picture of alchemy depicted by the analytical psychologist Carl 
					Jung and his supporter Mircea Eliade, the two American historians presented 
					"alchemy" as a vitalistic, secretive discipline permeated with mystical 
					religiosity, and "chemistry" as a public endeavor concerned with such 
					mundane pursuits as distillation, the refining of metals, and the 
					purification of salts.<sup>11</sup> This bifurcation served as a selection 
					criterion 
					for 
					Dobbs and Westfall, leading them to exclude much of Newton's chymistry from 
					their analysis of his "alchemy" (his chrysopoetic pursuits).  As a result, 
					they produced a picture of Newton's "alchemy" that was <i>a priori</i> skewed in the direction of vitalism, secrecy, and personal salvation.  The 
					proposed study and edition of Newton's chymical work will not employ the 
					anachronistic alchemy-chemistry distinction, and so we will not be guided by 
					a faulty selection criterion.  By including all of Newton's work in chemical 
					technology and metallurgy alongside his chrysopoeia, the study and edition 
					of Newton's chymical manuscripts will provide a far more balanced picture of 
					his interests. </p>
				<p>A third factor contributing to a successful outcome for the project will 
					lie in the laboratory.  During the last year, Newman, with the aid of 
					Cathrine Reck of the Indiana University Chemistry Department and Laura 
					Alexander, a laboratory assistant, has replicated a number of Newton's 
					chymical processes and apparatus.  The results of our work were filmed by 
					BBC and NOVA, who are jointly working on a Newton documentary.  We have been 
					able to recreate some of the metallic "trees" (dendrites) that formed the 
					probable inspiration for Newton's manuscript "Of Nature's Obvious Laws and 
					Processes in Vegetation" (metallic silicates, as well as silver crystals 
					grown under a solution of silver nitrate and mercury nitrate), the 
					star-regulus of antimony (a crystalline form of metallic antimony), and "the 
					net," a purple alloy of copper and antimony covered with an interesting 
					reticular surface.  We are continuing these experiments as we progress more 
					deeply into Newton's laboratory notebooks (Cambridge University Additional 
					MSS. 3973 and 3975), although our internal funding from IU will expire at 
					the end of the present semester.  Hence we are applying to the NSF for funds 
					to pay a laboratory assistant as the project progresses (a graduate student 
					in Chemistry will suffice), and to recoup the material costs involved in 
					laboratory replication.  With the aid of the Fine Arts Studio at IU, we have 
					also made a working replica of one of Newton's metallurgical furnaces 
					(illustrated and described in a manuscript kept in the Joseph Halle 
					Schaffner Collection in the University of Chicago Library).  Such 
					replications, largely eschewed by previous Newton-scholars, have the 
					advantage of teaching us about the actual successes and failures that Newton 
					experienced in the laboratory.  Although we can make educated guesses about 
					his chymical work from reading alone, there are often too many variables in 
					chemical research to make it possible to predict an exact outcome from 
					Newton's notes without recreating the apparatus and conditions under which 
					he performed his experiments.  For example, modern electrical furnaces do 
					not produce the complex mix of gases that can result in reducing atmospheres 
					in the case of charcoal-burning metallurgical furnaces (where open crucibles 
					are exposed to the atmosphere within the furnace).  The problem of 
					predicting experimental outcomes is compounded by Newton's use of 
					non-standard symbols and "cover-names" for substances.  Our goal, therefore, 
					is to determine exactly what processes Newton was carrying out, and why he 
					was performing the particular laboratory operations that he used.  This can 
					best be arrived at by means of an integrated program involving reading, 
					editing, and replicating Newton's chymical <i>oeuvre</i>. </p>
				<p> It is important to stress the emphatic need for such an integrated 
					project combining new research on Newton's chymistry with an online edition 
					of his manuscripts.  In a word, one cannot fully succeed without the other.  
					For example, an online, word-searchable edition of Newton's chymical <i>Nachlass</i> would make it possible to date the relative composition of 
					the various manuscripts much more reliably than Dobbs or Westfall did, since 
					it would allow one a fairly easy way of determining the distribution of 
					sources in Newton's unpublished notes and transcripts.  It would then become 
					feasible to determine the earliest occurrence of a given source in an 
					informed and reliable manner (the process would of course be checked against 
					results obtained from examining the watermarks on the manuscripts and 
					Newton's handwriting).<sup>12</sup> This sort of <i>Quellenforschung</i> or 
					source-criticism is one of the oldest tools of philology, but perhaps 
					because of the daunting size and disorder of Newton's chymical manuscripts, 
					no scholar has yet applied the technique to them.<sup>13</sup> An 
					electronic edition 
					would greatly facilitate this process as a result of word-searchability and 
					the possibilities of internal cross-referencing.  Once the order of 
					composition of the manuscripts was determined, one could then trace out the 
					development of Newton's chymical ideas over the thirty years or so that he 
					was an active experimenter in the field.  Newman's proposed monograph on 
					Newton's chymistry would then present this result and use it as a means of 
					describing the evolution of Newton's chymical thought and practice over 
					time. </p>
