						William R. Newman took part in NOVA/BBC filming of a documentary about Isaac Newton's alchemy and theology.  With the aid of the Indiana University Chemistry Department, Newman replicated a number of Newton's laboratory processes, and built a working replica of one of his metallurgical furnaces.  All of this was filmed for the documentary, which appeared in 2005 as "Newton's Dark Secrets."  WGBH, producers of NOVA, have posted an accompanying  interactive webpage which may be viewed at the following: <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/newton/" target="_blank">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/newton/</a>.
